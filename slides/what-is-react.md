## The `V` in `MVC`

React processes only user interfaces in applications. This corresponds to View in the Model-View-Controller template

---

#### Component-Based

UI is built up using [*components*](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/components-and-props.html#functional-and-class-components)

Everything in React is a component. As your app grows, there's nothing more to learn; just build more modular components

#### [Declarative](http://bit.ly/2uuw8lK)

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug

No direct manipulation of the DOM - components are re-rendered automatically when data/state changes occur
